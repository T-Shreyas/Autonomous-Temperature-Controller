# Autonomous-Temperature-Controller
In this project i have built a system that can monitor the temperature of a system and trigger a mechanism to control it using Arduino, with LabVIEW as the interface.
By continuously monitoring the temperature of a system, the project aims to control the temperature such that it is within a specified range.
This can be used to control the cooling systems of temperature-critical applications such as in nuclear power plants. 
The temperature and humidity are being represented in the form of a graph in LabVIEW.
